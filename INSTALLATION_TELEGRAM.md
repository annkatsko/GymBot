# Telegram Installation

Consuming the Susi API with Telegram is fairly straightforward in telegram. The use of `botfather` in telegram ensures 
that the bots can be created with ease. 
So the first step is to login into telegram with your user account and search and talk to `BotFather`. Bot father would 
ask a few questions and then provide the required token.

Once Token is got, you need to update it in config.py.

`TG_BOT_TOKEN = 24243rd2353-TOKEN-23rknvdv`
